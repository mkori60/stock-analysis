# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to help Steve analyze stocks for his parents to invest in beginning with the DQ stock. 

## Results
Overall, the stocks analyzed performed much better in 2017 than 2018. Steve should notify his parents that they should not invest in DQ because it did not perform well in either 2017 or 2018.

As shown, out of the stocks analyzed, ENPH and RUN performed the best over the course of 2017 annd 2018. Steve should advise his parents to invest in these stocks instead. 

To get the percent of return for each stock, I created a Nested For loop that looped through all the stocks. Before beginning, we were provided with a list of steps that we needed to follow:

As shown below, the time it took to run the code also improved after refactoring.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The advantages of refactoring code is that it makes the code simpler and easier to debug, easier for others to read your code, and can make the code run faster which becomes important if it is dealing with a large amount of data. A disadvantage is that refactoring can cause errors if it is not done correctly. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring made the original VBA script simpler and easier to read. Refactoring also made the code run in significantly less time. In this case, that small amount of time saved is not significant. However, if we wanted to apply this code to a much larger set of stocks, then the saved time would become significant.
